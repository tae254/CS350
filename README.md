Our project assignment centered on crafting a thermostat with the capability to manage a home's heating/cooling system. We dove into the intricacies, employing I2C, GPIO, and UART to facilitate support for peripherals and communication protocols. Through UART, seamless communication with different systems was established via a Wi-Fi connection, while the inter-connected peripherals engaged in communication using the I2C protocol. The crucial role of GPIO emerged in system control, especially when dealing with the buttons strategically positioned on the board's sides, particularly when the USB orientation is in the top left corner.
The system's functionality is grounded in monitoring ambient temperature via an onboard sensor, performing periodic checks to decide if the heat should be deactivated, indicated by a red LED. The side buttons contribute to this process, enabling the adjustment of the set point temperature; the left button decreases it, while the right button increases it.
When conducting a comparative analysis of various controller board models, our options included boards from TI, Microchip, and Freescale. All three demonstrated their capability to support the necessary peripherals. However, scrutiny of the chips on these boards brought forth a concern with the Freescale model, which utilized OTP memory, posing a restriction on reprogramming possibilities. Consequently, our focus narrowed down to the TI and Microchip boards. In the decision-making phase, the integrated temperature sensor emerged as a pivotal factor. Despite the potentially higher cost associated with the TI board, its integrated temperature sensor became a deciding factor in its favor.
